## Core Features:

- Offline Identity Creation: Enable users to generate and store their digital identity entirely offline.
- Satellite Data Transmission: Implement secure and efficient transmission of identity data packets via satellite.
- Blockchain Identity Registration: Register the transmitted identity data on the blockchain to ensure immutability.
- Offline Verification Tool: Enable offline verification of identities using locally stored or satellite-transmitted Merkle proofs.
- QR Code Support: Create QR codes to import into identity apps and verifier tools, facilitating offline data sharing.
- Cost Monitoring Tool: An AI tool to estimate identity-registration cost (in $USD) before posting transaction based on current fees and network congestion, and suggests optimal settings. (This can save the user money).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1A237E) to evoke trust and security, mirroring the stability of satellite communication.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and neutral base, ensuring readability and focus.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and indicate data transmission, reflecting technological sophistication.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent data, transmission, and verification states. Ensure icons are easily recognizable in low-bandwidth scenarios.
- Maintain a minimalist layout with clear visual hierarchy, optimizing for low-data usage and accessibility. Prioritize key actions and information.
- Employ subtle, non-intrusive animations to indicate processing and synchronization states, enhancing the user experience without adding unnecessary data load.
